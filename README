Folders:

- dataset: starting material for the project
- tools: g2o and geometry helpers
- inspect dataset: visualization of the GT and the measurements contained in the dataset
- 2DLSBasedBearingOnlySLAM: 2D least squares based SLAM using bearing measurements only 


How to run:

- to inspect the dataset:
    cd inspect_dataset
    octave-cli 
    inspect_dataset 
    (close the figures in order to proceed)

- to perform bearing-only SLAM:
    cd 2DLSBasedBearingOnlySLAM
    octave-cli 
    main
